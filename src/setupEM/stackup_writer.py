Load/edit/save/validate stackup XML files (see XML_stackup_format.md) at the
xml.etree.ElementTree level, independent of any GUI toolkit.

This module is deliberately kept separate from gds2palace's util_stackup_reader.py:
the reader turns XML into the read-only object model (stackup_material,
dielectric_layer, metal_layer, ...) used by the rest of gds2palace, while this
module is for tools that need to load a file, edit it (materials/dielectrics/
layers/tables), and write it back out - such as this GUI stackup editor - while
leaving any parts of the file they don't understand (e.g. XML comments)
completely untouched. It lives here in setupEM rather than in gds2palace because
setupEM is its only real consumer - gds2palace's own workflow only ever reads
stackup files, never edits/writes them.
