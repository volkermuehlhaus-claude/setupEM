stackupEditor.py

GUI editor for stackup XML files (see gds2palace/XML_stackup_format.md):
Variables, Materials, the Dielectric stack, drawn Layers, and DerivedLayers
(boolean layer operations), with a live cross-section preview reusing
setup_common.VectorWidget. Normally opened from Tools > Edit Stackup XML... in
setupEM / setupThermal (wired up in setup_common.MainWindowBase.create_menu_bar(),
so it is available in both apps for free) - but also runnable standalone, either
directly (`python stackupEditor.py [file.xml]`) or via the `stackupEditor` console
script installed with this package (see main() below and pyproject.toml).

Tables (thermal conductivity lookups) is not editable here. Loading goes
through gds2palace.stackup_writer.load_stackup_tree(), which preserves XML
comments, and only Variable/Material/Dielectric/Layer/Substrate/DerivedLayer
elements are ever touched, so Tables - and any comments in it - round-trips
untouched on save.

        """container_fn(root) -> list[Element]: fetches the current rows to display,
           re-called by reload() so the editor can refresh itself after any structural
           change (add/remove/move) without the caller having to re-fetch and hand
           back the list every time.

           strip_fn(element): called once per row on every reload, to silently drop
             attributes that don't apply given the row's current values (e.g. a
             Conductor material's Permittivity) so the XML doesn't accumulate
             meaningless defaults - the reader already defaults them on read.
           not_applicable_fn(element, attr) -> bool: for "text" columns, forces a
             blank, read-only display (the value is fixed at its default and not
             user-editable in this row's context).
           blank_if_default_fn(element, attr, value) -> bool: for "text" columns,
             shows blank instead of a value that's just the (uninteresting) default,
             while leaving the cell normally editable.
           reload_on_attr_change: attribute names whose change should trigger a full
             self.reload() (e.g. "Type", since it changes which columns apply).
           compute_fn(elements) -> {id(element): {attr: display_str}}: called once per
             reload() (not per row, since e.g. dielectric z-stacking needs the whole
             ordered list at once), feeding "computed" kind columns - values that are
             derived, not stored as an XML attribute, and therefore always read-only.
           gray_fn(element, attr) -> bool: tints a "text" or "computed" cell's
             background gray without affecting whether it's editable - use this
             (instead of not_applicable_fn) when a column is still meaningful/editable
             but just isn't the row's current source of truth (e.g. absolute Zmin/Zmax
             on a row that's actually using Thickness-based auto-stacking).
           pre_set_attr_fn(element, attr, new_value) -> bool: called before a "text"
             column's value is applied, with the element still unmodified (so the
             hook can read the old value itself); if it returns True it has fully
             handled applying the change (and any side effects, e.g. a confirmation
             dialog with cross-tab consequences) and the normal element.set()/attrib
             deletion is skipped; False means apply the value normally.
           reference_choices_fn() -> list[str]: choices for the "layerref_or_dielectricref"/
             "dielectricref" kinds. For Layers this combines two different element containers
             (Dielectrics + Layers) - unlike material_choices_fn, which only ever spans one; for
             Dielectrics it's Dielectric names only (a Dielectric's Reference can't target a
             Layer - Layers are resolved after Dielectrics).
           table_choices_fn() -> list[str]: declared Table names, for the "tableref" kind
             (Materials' ThermalConductivityTable column).
           header_tooltips: {attr: tooltip text} for columns whose header label alone
             could be misread (e.g. Zmin/Zmax meaning different things depending on
             whether the row uses Reference).
           operand_lookup_fn() -> {layer number string: layer name}: for the "operands"
             kind, used to build a per-cell tooltip resolving each GDSII layer number to
             its Layers-tab Name where possible, falling back to the bare number for
             whichever operands don't resolve (e.g. a pure intermediate derived layer
             with no <Layer> entry of its own).
           variable_names_fn() -> list[str], optional: current declared Variable names, used
             to attach a QCompleter to every "text" column's editor (see
             _VariableCompletionDelegate) - lets a user type "=" and pick a matching variable
             from a popup instead of typing the full name. Omit for a tab where this doesn't
             make sense (there currently isn't one, but the param stays optional for safety).
           invalid_fn(element, attr) -> bool: for "text" columns, marks a cell's text
             (not background, unlike gray_fn) dark red - used for the one specific
             field whose edit was what just made the whole file invalid (see
             StackupEditorWindow._is_invalid_field()), so the user's eye lands on the
             actual cause instead of just the generic status line/Save error list.
           reorder_fn(root, ordered_elements): reorders the underlying XML elements
             to match ordered_elements, enabling click-a-header-to-sort (by that
             column's current value) on every "text"/"computed" column. This is a
             one-time reorder, not a persistent "stay sorted" mode - editing/adding
             rows afterward doesn't re-sort, so a new row being filled in doesn't
             jump around before it's finished. Omit to leave headers unclickable.
           descending_attrs: attribute names that should sort largest-first when
             their header is clicked (e.g. a z-position column, so the physically
             topmost layer lands at the top of the list) - every other numeric
             column sorts smallest-first. A row whose value can't be parsed as a
             number always sorts last, regardless of direction.

       updates happen by calling that widget's refresh(), so this window
       doesn't need any refresh logic of its own.

    VectorWidget (addWidget() reparents it), so destroying this window on
    close would destroy that widget too, breaking the editor that still
    references it. Closing (the X button) just hides the window instead.

    Deliberately constructed with NO Qt parent (see StackupEditorWindow,
    which passes none): on Windows, any widget with a Qt parent gets a native
    "owner" window set, and an owned window always stays above its owner
    regardless of focus - the preview would permanently float over the
    editor. Neither QDialog(parent, Qt.Window) nor QWidget(parent, Qt.Window)
    stopped this in testing; only removing the parent relationship entirely
    did. Without a Qt parent there is no automatic cascade-delete when the

    deleteLater() on this window instead of relying on Qt object-tree cleanup.
