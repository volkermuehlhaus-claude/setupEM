setup_common.py

Shared building blocks for the setupEM (Palace/Elmer EM) and setupThermal
(Elmer thermal) PySide6 GUI applications. This module holds only the pieces
that are genuinely identical (or parameterizably identical) between the two
apps: style constants, small helpers, the file-input tab, the Python code
editor/highlighter, the stackup cross-section preview widget, the shared
"Create Model" tab base class, and the shared "MainWindow" base class.

Anything that differs in real behavior between the two apps (ports vs.
thermal objects data model, frequency sweep settings, Palace/Elmer specific
mesh fields, the Python model code generator bodies) is intentionally left
in setupEM.py / setupThermal.py, not here.

        used for Ports/Thermal tab UI hints (next-available-layer suggestion,

        layout (fill patterns, via arrays) made that flatten cost tens of
        seconds per call, multiple times, before the user did anything else.
        Falls back to the original read_gds()-based computation only when a
        stackup "derived layer" (util_stackup_reader.derived_layer - a
        synthetic layer computed via boolean ops on other real layers, whose
